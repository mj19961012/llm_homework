Hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls.  This place has none of them.  It is april and there are no grass tees yet.  BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month.  The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene's house.  Worn and thread bare.  Let's talk about the hours.  This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  Oh, they are cash only also.\\\\n\\\\nBottom line, this place sucks.

Unlike other reviewers I found the decor to be over the top and rather...hodge-podge, they have so many different types of materials: marble, tile, rock, paint, carpet, etc. that the place really lacks cohesion ( I'm an interior designer, so it's entirely possible I'm just pickier than most). Their chairs were super comfy though. \\n\\nI went here with my husband and my parents, since it's down the street from their new place. We went during happy hour, they have a pretty good happy hour menu, but don't have any of their specialty rolls on it. Their specialty  rolls seemed a bit overpriced and some of their classic rolls they made cheaper by taking out ingredients. I've never had a Las Vegas roll with only 3 ingredients or a Shrimp tempura roll with only 2. \\n\\nAll of their rolls with salmon came with smoked salmon, so I specifically asked if I could order rolls with normal salmon and was told I could absolutely do that. We proceeded to order 2 Las Vegas rolls, 1 with regular salmon. We also ordered a Shrimp tempura roll, a Rainbow roll, Gyoza, Honey Chicken and Sweet and Sour Chicken. \\n\\nWhen our waitress delivered the rolls I asked her which Vegas roll had the regular salmon, she gave me a blank look and said I'd never ordered that, that the roll comes with smoked salmon, as if the conversation about it had never happened. She also said something along the lines of \\\"It's hard to redo deep fried rolls\\\" implying they wouldn't take the roll back. That just really annoyed me, she made the mistake, she knew it and wouldn't own up to it. I didn't push it, because there wasn't that much salmon in the rolls anyway, they were mostly rice, they tasted ok. The Tempura roll was good as was the Rainbow roll (though most of the toppings were shrimp instead of the 4 types of fish you usually get). The Gyoza, Honey chicken and Sweet and Sour chicken were all delicious. \\n\\nAll in all I just felt like their rolls were very cheaply made. Perhaps they should have spent less on the decor and put more into their fish budget. If we came here again it would probably be for the Chinese food and not for the sushi.</td>\n",

The place was small and the sign in front is barely noticeable and I fully expected to see Dozens bakery when I looked through the window, but I was pleasantly surprised to see waffle irons at work.  I have been dying to find a place that serves fresh hot waffles for a long time now. My boyfriend and I tried the fancified versions of the waffle at first, mine topped with whipped cream and fresh strawberries and his with a chocolate-hazelnut spread (I can't remember if it was Nutella or some other brand) and sliced bananas.  Regardless of the small \\\"dining\\\" area we were fully satisfied with our waffles.  They were warm and fluffy and light so you get a fulfilling snack without it being too heavy.  Perfect snack after the movie while we waited for the bus.  We stopped in on a different occasion after dinner on a cold rainy day to grab a few of the plain sugar waffles to go.  These were perfectly portable and delicious.  I think I prefer them this way, without all of the extra toppings.  \\n\\nOne other thing that I like about this place is that they accept cards, which is very convenient for people like me, who never carry any cash.  \\n\\nIt's too bad that I don't live in Squirrel Hill anymore.  Otherwise, I'd stop by more often.  They need to advertise their shop a bit more because I had no idea that they were there.  I even missed the sign in front.

But no fries, and not even 5 cents worth of potato chips on the side...and they charge $25 for what looks like a child's portion.  And to be fair, the lobster rolls tasted pretty good.
